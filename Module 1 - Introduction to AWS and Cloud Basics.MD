### **What Is AWS?**
AWS is a cloud service provider that helps businesses with:  
- Basic tools: Compute power, storage, and network security.  
- Advanced tools: Machine learning, blockchain, and even satellite management.  

**Key Idea**: AWS is flexible, meaning you can scale (grow or shrink) your resources based on your needs.

### **Understanding the Client-Server Model**  
The **client-server model** is how most computing works today:  
- A **client** (e.g., web browser or app) makes a request.  
- A **server** (e.g., Amazon EC2) processes and responds to that request.

**Example**:  
- You ask for a news article (client request).  
- The server finds it and sends it back to you.

### **What Is Cloud Computing?**  
Cloud computing means getting IT resources (servers, storage, etc.) online, when you need them.  

**Three Key Features**:  
1. **On-Demand**: Use resources only when needed.  
2. **Pay-As-You-Go**: Pay only for what you use.  
3. **Flexibility**: Easily add or remove resources.

### **Types of Cloud Deployment**  
1. **Cloud-Based**: Everything is on the cloud. Example: An app built entirely using AWS tools.  
2. **On-Premises**: Everything is managed on-site (private cloud). Example: A local company server room.  
3. **Hybrid**: A mix of cloud and on-premises. Example: Old systems stay local, while new data is processed in the cloud.

### **Benefits of Cloud Computing**  
1. **Save Money**: No upfront costs for hardware, only pay for what you use.  
2. **Less Maintenance**: AWS handles servers, so you focus on your apps.  
3. **Scale Quickly**: Add or remove resources as needed.  
4. **Lower Costs**: AWS benefits from economies of scale, so prices are lower.  
5. **Speed and Agility**: Get resources in minutes, not weeks.  
6. **Global Reach**: Serve customers worldwide with low delays.
